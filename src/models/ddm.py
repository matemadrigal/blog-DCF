Dividend Discount Model (DDM) Implementation.

This module implements multiple DDM variants following CFA Institute methodology
and industry best practices from Wall Street institutions.

Models Implemented:
1. Gordon Growth Model (Constant Growth DDM)
2. Two-Stage DDM
3. H-Model (Half-Life Growth Model)
